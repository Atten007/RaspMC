# RaspMC
RaspMC is a completely free Minecraft server software that currently only works on all the 64-bit Raspberry Pi.
I've written this software in Python 3.6.8, but it should also work on Python 3.7 and newer. 
It also works on all Minecraft versions beginning with the 1.7.10 until the 1.18.1! 
Please note that this Minecraft server software is currently not official and it's in an alpha state (22.0a1) and please also note that this server software currently only works on the Minecraft: Java Edition. 
If you only have the Minecraft: Pocket Edition on your mobile device or the Bedrock Edition on your PC and/or your console, see this here: https://github.com/Atten007/RaspMCPE.
At least 512MB RAM is required or RaspMC won't work! To start this server, simply double click the file "main.py" or please use the shell script.
Have fun playing Minecraft on your new completely free Minecraft: Java Edition server on your Raspberry Pi!
